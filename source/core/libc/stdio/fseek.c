 * Sets file position for stream stream and clears end-of-file indicator.
 * For a binary stream, file position is set to offset bytes from the position
 * indicated by origin: beginning of file for SEEK_SET, current position for
 * SEEK_CUR, or end of file for SEEK_END. Behaviour is similar for a text
 * stream, but offset must be zero or, for SEEK_SET only, a value returned by
 * ftell.
 * Returns non-zero on error.
